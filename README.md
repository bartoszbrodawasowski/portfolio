## About me
👋 Welcome to my portfolio page! I am Bartosz and I am motivated to become a software tester. <br />
💻 I graduated Computer Science. As part of my studies, I expand my interests in the area of graphic's design and computer networks.<br />
👷🏽 Despite the fact that my jobs were not directly related to the IT industry, technology and games are an important part of my life.<br />
📈 My goal is to develop testing knowlage and technical skills.<br />
🎮 In this portfolio I would like to show my non-commercial projects and what I have learned.
