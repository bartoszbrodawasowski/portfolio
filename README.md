## About me
üëã Welcome to my portfolio page! I am Bartosz and I am motivated to become a software tester. <br />
üíª I graduated Computer Science. As part of my studies, I expand my interests in the area of graphic's design and computer networks.<br />
üë∑üèΩ Despite the fact that my jobs were not directly related to the IT industry, technology and games are an important part of my life.<br />
üìà My goal is to develop testing knowlage and technical skills.<br />
üéÆ In this portfolio I would like to show my non-commercial projects and what I have learned.

## Projects
Headset for Freetrack. <br />
Freetrack is a program that transfers the user's head movements to the computer using a camera and headset. It can be used, for example, to facilitate access for people with disabilities. In my case, I used it for aviation simulators.<br />
